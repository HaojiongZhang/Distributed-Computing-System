In the vast canvas of night, stars gleam so bright,
Every twinkle, every shimmer, filled with stars' light.
Between the countless stars, dreams quietly depart,
Lost in the luminous art, where stars play their part.

Stars above, stars below, in reflections they spark,
Dreams barely seen, like shadows in the dark.
The stars' chorus, a melody of radiant beams,
Overshadows the fleeting, hazy dreams.

In the embrace of stars, where night seems so vast,
Whispers are rare, dreams fading fast.
Yet in this realm, where the stars do reign,
Dreams are eclipsed, while stars remain.

By               yours truly,
Pickle Man.
